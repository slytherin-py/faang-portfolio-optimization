# FAANG Portfolio Optimization

A project that looks at the stock prices of the FAANG companies (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) from 2020 to 2023 and helps figure out the best way to invest in them. Using some classic finance ideas, it finds the portfolio that gives you the best return for the risk you’re willing to take.

---

## What’s this about?

The goal here is to analyze historical stock data for these five big tech companies and build a smart investment portfolio. Instead of just guessing or putting equal money into each stock, this project uses something called Modern Portfolio Theory to balance risk and reward.

You’ll see how to:

* Load and prepare stock data with Python
* Calculate daily returns and annualized stats
* Compare a simple equal-weight portfolio with optimized ones
* Find portfolios that minimize risk or maximize return for that risk
* Visualize the stock trends and portfolio results

---

## How to run it

First, make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Then, install the libraries used here:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib PyPortfolioOpt
```

Clone the repo and go to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slytherin-py/faang-portfolio-optimization.git
cd faang-portfolio-optimization
```

Put the `faang_stocks.csv` file inside the project folder, then run the main script:

```bash
python portfolio_analysis.py
```

Or open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis step-by-step.

## About the data

The dataset contains daily closing prices for the FAANG stocks over a few years. Each row is one trading day, and columns show prices for each stock.

---

## What you’ll get

* Returns and risk for a portfolio that puts equal money in each stock
* Portfolio weights that minimize risk
* Portfolio weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio (basically the best return per risk)
* Plots showing how the stock prices moved over time
